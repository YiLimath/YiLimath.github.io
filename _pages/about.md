I am a second-year graduate student at Wuhan University. My research interests lie in **Birational Geometry and Hodge theory**. I maintain this website to keep track of the topics I study and, most importantly, to document my discoveries along my research journey.


## Research Interest

Currently I mainly work on: 

(1) The KÃ¤hler minimal model program, with applications to deformation problems;

(2) The boundedness problem in birational geometry and the moduli aspects of birational geometry;

(3) The machine aid birational geometry.
