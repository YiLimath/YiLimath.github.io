I am a second-year graduate student at Wuhan University. My research interests lie in Birational Geometry (and Hodge theory is my hobby). I enjoy studying topics related to the (Kahler) minimal model program, bounded and moduli problems. 

I maintain this website to keep track of the things I study, and most importantly my discoveries along the journey of my research. (I will try to explain the secrets and insight behind the topics we discussed).
