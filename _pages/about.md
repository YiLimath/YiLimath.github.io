I am a second-year graduate student at Wuhan University. My research interests lie in **Birational Geometry and Hodge theory** (I am also interested in learning some basic knowledge of the geometric Langlands program and mirror symmetry). I maintain this website to keep track of the topics I study and, most importantly, to document my discoveries along my research journey. (I will also try to explain the secrets and insights behind the topics we discuss.)


## Research Interest

Currently I mainly work on: 

(1) The Kähler minimal model program, with applications to deformation problems;

(2) The boundedness problem in birational geometry and the moduli aspects of birational geometry;
