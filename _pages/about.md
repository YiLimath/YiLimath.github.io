I am a second-year graduate student at Wuhan University under the supervision of [Sheng Rao](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/raosheng/en/index/427596/list/index.htm) and [Christopher Hacon](https://www.math.utah.edu/~hacon/). My research interests lie in **Birational Geometry and Hodge theory**. I maintain this website to keep track of the topics I study and, most importantly, to document my discoveries along my research journey. (I will also try to explain the secrets and insights behind the topics we discuss.)


## Research Interest

Currently I mainly work on: 

(1) The KÃ¤hler minimal model program, with applications to deformation problems;

(2) The boundedness problem in birational geometry and the moduli aspects of birational geometry;

(3) I am also studying topics related to the geometric Langlands program and mirror symmetry.
