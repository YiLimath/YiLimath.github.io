I am a second-year graduate student at Wuhan University. My research interests lie in Birational Geometry and Hodge theory. I enjoy studying topics related to the minimal model program, rationality problems, deformation and moduli problems. (I maintain this website primarily for myself, to keep track of the things I study.)
