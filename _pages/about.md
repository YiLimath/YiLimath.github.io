I am a third-year graduate student at Wuhan University under the supervision of Sheng Rao and [Christopher D. Hacon](https://www.math.utah.edu/~hacon/). My research interests lie in **Birational Geometry and Moduli theory**. I maintain this website to keep track of the topics I study and, most importantly, to document my discoveries along my research journey. 


## Research Interest

Currently I mainly work on: 

(1) The Kähler minimal model program with applications to deformation problems;

(2) I also study the structure of Kähler Calabi-Yau varieties and varieties with nef anti-canonical divisors;

(3) The boundedness problem in birational geometry and the moduli aspects of birational geometry;
