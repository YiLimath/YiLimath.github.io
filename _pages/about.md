I am a second-year graduate student at Wuhan University. My research interests lie in Birational Geometry (and Hodge theory is my hobby). I enjoy studying topics related to the minimal model program, rationality problems and deformation and moduli problems. (I maintain this website primarily for myself, to keep track of the things I study. The best way to learn something is to learn it slowly. "少则得, 多则惑".)
