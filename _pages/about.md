I am a second-year graduate student at Wuhan University under the supervision of [Sheng Rao](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/raosheng/en/index.htm), and [Christopher D. Hacon](https://www.math.utah.edu/~hacon/). My research interests lie in Birational Geometry, with Hodge theory as a hobby. I enjoy studying topics related to the (KÃ¤hler) Minimal Model Program, as well as boundedness and moduli problems. I maintain this website to keep track of the topics I study and, most importantly, to document my discoveries along my research journey. (I will also try to explain the secrets and insights behind the topics we discuss.)
