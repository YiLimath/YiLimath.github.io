I am a first-year graduate student at Wuhan University. My research interests lie in Birational Geometry and Complex Geometry. I enjoy studying topics related to the minimal model program, rationality questions, and deformation and moduli problems. (While I am not yet an expert in these subjects, I am striving to produce high-quality publications during my time here.)
