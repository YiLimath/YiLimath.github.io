I am a second-year graduate student at Wuhan University. My research interests lie in Birational Geometry and Complex Geometry. I enjoy studying topics related to the minimal model program, rationality questions, and deformation and moduli problems. (I maintain this website primarily for myself, to keep track of the things I study, while I am not yet an expert in these subjects, I am striving to produce high-quality publications during my time here.)
