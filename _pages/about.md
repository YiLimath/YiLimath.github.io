I am a third-year graduate student at Wuhan University under the supervision of Sheng Rao and [Christopher D. Hacon](https://www.math.utah.edu/~hacon/). My research interests lie in **Birational Geometry and Moduli theory**. I maintain this website to keep track of the topics I study and, most importantly, to document my discoveries along my research journey. 


## Research Interest

Currently I mainly work on: 

(1) Kahler minimal model program and its applications to deformation problems;

(2) Structure of K\"ahler Calabi--Yau varieties and varieties with nef anticanonical divisors;

(3) Boundedness and moduli aspects of birational geometry.
