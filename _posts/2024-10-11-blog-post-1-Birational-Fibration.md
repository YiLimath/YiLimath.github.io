The aim of this series of note is to introduce the fibration in birational geometry (classification theory of complex algebraic/analytic varieties). 

(1) [Iitaka fibration](),

(2) [A brief introduction to Iitaka conjecture](),

(3) [Albanese map](),

(3) [MRC fibration](), 

(4) [Gamma reduction](),

(5) [Pseudo-effective reduction](),

(6) [Nef reduction](),

## Note-1: Iitaka fibration

In this note we will

### Relation with the boundedness of general type
Recall that we prove

## Note-3: MRC fibration
---

In this part of notes, we will systematically study the MRC fibration. We will first introduce some basic properties about MRC fibrations, and then give a introduction about the recent research question around the MRC fibration.
