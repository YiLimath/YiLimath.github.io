The aim of this series of notes is to summarize the base properties about stable base locus, augmented base locus, restricted base locus which will be used over and over again in birational geometry.


(1) Part I: Base locus, fixed part, mobile part. 

(2) Part II: Stable base locus, restricted base locus and augmented base locus. In this part, we will summarize some basic properties about these three locus. Here are the topics that will be covered in this part of note: We will study the basic properties of these 3 locus, and the relations between them. We will study these 3 locus in the MMP. 

(3) Part III: Non-KLT locus. NKLT locus is one of the central object in birational geometry. We will study this locus in greate details. Here are the topics that will be covered in this part of note: Basic properties of NKLT locus, Shokurov rationally connected theorem,

## Note-2 Stable base locus, restricted base locus and augmented base locus

Stable base locus is defined to be , 

As for the applications in the minimal model program. We have the following useful facts.
