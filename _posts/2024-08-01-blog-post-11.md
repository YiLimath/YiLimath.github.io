In this note we will prove for 1-parameter semistable degeneration, the special fiber has limiting mixed Hodge structur as well as mixed Hodge complex of sheaves

For detailed information see my reading notes [Existence of limiting mixed Hodge structure](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Hodge/LimitingMHS.pdf)
