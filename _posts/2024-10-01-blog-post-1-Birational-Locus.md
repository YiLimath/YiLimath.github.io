## Note-3 Stable base locus, restricted base locus and augmented base locus

In this note, we first study the relations between stable base locus, restricted base locus and augmented base locus. We then prove some basic properties that these locus satisfies. We end this note by studying some applications in the minimal model theory.


We first show some relation between these three locus: In general we have restricted base locus contains in the stable base locus and contains in the augmented base locus.

There are some cases that they coinside. When 

Compared with the stable base locus, what nice about restricted base locus and augmented base locus are they are numerically invariant. 

As for the applications in the minimal model program. We have the following useful results:

(1) The set of exceptional divisors of the minimal model coinside with the restricted base locus of the log canonical divisor. If in addition it's a good minimal model, then it also coinside with the stable base locus. 


Let us briefly sketch the idea of the proof. We first apply the Nakayama's Zariski decomposition, and try to show that the exceptional divisors of the minimal model coinside with the negative part of the Zariski decomposition. The result of the proof is standard, we show that divisorial part of restricted base locus coinside with negative part of the Zariski decomposition. When the divisor is big, restricted base locus is the same as the stable base locus. And thus we complete the proof.

## Note-3 Non-KLT locus Part 1: Kollár-Shokurov connectedness principle

NKLT locus is one of the central object in birational geometry. It will be the key to understand the log canonical geometry. Non-KLT locus has fruitful geometric structure. We will study this locus in greate details. 

Here are the topics that will be covered in this part of note: Basic properties of NKLT locus, Kollar-Shokurov connected principal.


Kollár-Shokurov connectedness principle has many interesting applications:

## Note-4 Nef locus, Kahler locus


In the end of this note, we will show some applications of the basic properties about nef locus, Kahler locus we deduce above.
