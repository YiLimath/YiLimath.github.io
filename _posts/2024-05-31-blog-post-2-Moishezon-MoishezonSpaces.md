Last time, we proved some elementary properties of Moishezon spaces. This time, we will continue our discussion about the basic properties of Moishezon spaces. We will then go to Section 3 of the paper, where we will prove the equivalence of different definitions of Moishezon morphisms.


For the detailed discussion see my lecture notes: [Moishezon morphism part 2](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Birational/Moishezon/Moishezon-morphism2.pdf)
