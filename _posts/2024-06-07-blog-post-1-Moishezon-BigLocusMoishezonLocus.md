We will continue our discussion on the paper [Moishezon morphism](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/pamq/content/vols/0018/0004/a011/index.php?mode=ns). First, we will complete the proof that Moishezon morphism is stable under base change. Then, we will delve into today's main topic: the alternation property of the very big locus, general type locus, and Moishezon locus, which is either nowhere dense or contains some dense open subset.
