Birational Geometry of varieties with maximal Albanese dimension is well understood. The aim of this note is to give a proof of classical results in birational geometry that related to the varieties with maximal Albanese dimension. 


[1. Existence of good minimal models and abundance for varieties with maximal Albanese dimension]()

[2. Existence of good minimal models under the Kahler setting]()

[3. Theorem of Jiang-Lahoz-Tirabassi: Explicit Effective birationality of Kodaira map when variety is of general type with maximal Albanese dimension]()
