The aim of this series of notes is to introduce topos theory and artificial intelligence. The goal of these notes can be expressed by the following sentence from the foreword of Semio Physics by the mathematician RenÃ© Thom:
> The philosophical program I had in mind for Catastrophe Theory, namely the geometrization of thought and linguistic activity.

The goal of this note is to study how topos theory can serve as a foundation for the geometrization of linguistic and logical activity.
