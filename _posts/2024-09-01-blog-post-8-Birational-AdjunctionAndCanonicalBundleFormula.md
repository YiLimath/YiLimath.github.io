In this part of note we will introduce adjunction theory in Birational Geometry. Among the techniques in birational geometry, adjunction theory is one of the most
powerful tools. It allows to relate the geometry, and in particular the singularities,
of the ambient variety with the one of appropriate subvarieites. This note is organized as follows. The first part is about adjunction formula (with varies type of singularities). The second part is about the inversion of adjunction with different variants. The third part is about subadjunction formula (which is sometimes also called adjunction on the NKLT centers). The last part is about the canonial bundle formulas (which is sometimes also called adjunction on the fibration). A nice summary about it can be found in the paper [Anti-pluricanonical systems
on Fano varieties, Chapter 3](https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2019/190-2/p01). Our note will base on this paper. And we try to give a more detailed introduction to the adjunction theory.

## Note-1 Adjunction formulas

### Easy adjunction theorem
The theorem says that discrepancy inside S can be seen outside. Thus, bad singularity inside S can be detected from outside. If the singularity of (X,B+S) is nice, then the singularity inside S can not be too bad. How to prove this? Well

## Note-2 Inversion of adjunction

### (1) Classical version inversion of adjunction

Before going deeper into the the theory of inversion of adjunction. Let us first study the classical version inversion of adjunction (which can be found in [KM96, Theorem 5.50]). The theorem says that for a normal variety X with a normal divisor S. The pair (X,B+S) is PLT(LC) iff the restriction on S is KLT (LC). 


Let us briefly sketch the idea of the proof. We will divide the proof into several steps:

(1) Easy adjunction theorem, which already be done in Note-1. 

(2) Kollár-Shokurov connectedness theorem: 

(3) Proof of the inversion of adjunction: One direction is an immediate consequence of easy adjunction theorem. Only needs to prove the converse direction, which require the Kollár-Shokurov connectedness theorem. The idea is note that S lies over the NKLT center, if there is any exceptional with coefficint than 1 (lies over S). It must be detected by S, using connectedness principle. Now the singularity inside S is nice, thus the singularity near S must also be nice.

Let us now study the inversion of adjunction for Moishezon space (which appears in [Kol2]). The major difficulity that we will face in the Moishezon setting, will be the minimal model theory over analytic base is not known. 


### (2) Hacon's generalization of inversion of adjunction
