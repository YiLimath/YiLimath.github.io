The aim of this note is to introduce the minimal model program for Kahler varieties. Compared with the well-known minimal model program for projective varieties, the theory of Kahler minimal model program will have the following three major difficulties: (1) Mori bend-and-break technique: Mori bend and break is not known for Kahler varieties, (2) The base point free theorem and cone theorem: Since Kahler manifold with a big line bundle is automatic projective, thus a big line bundle does not make sense on (non-projective) Kahler manifold, (3) Contraction theorem: In the classical MMP, we require the base point free theorem to produce some semi-ampleness divisor. This semi-ample divisor will induce the negative contraction morphism, and this approach is not very clear under Kaehler setting.

> In general, we aim to study the following question: To what extent are natural geometric or sheaf-theoretic constructions on compact Kähler manifolds determined by analogous constructions in the projective setting? Further structural results could provide a general framework for reducing certain questions about Kähler manifolds to the algebraic setting.
