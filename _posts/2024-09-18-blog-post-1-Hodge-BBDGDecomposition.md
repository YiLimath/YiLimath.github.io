The aim of this note is to introduce the BBDG decomposition theorem. As quoted from the book [Hodge Theory](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691161341/hodge-theory?srsltid=AfmBOorrGTQOZE3t3DRM0ayg5JypipazvwASdg1d5J-TlBLMmYAWr389). BBDG decomposition theorem is the deepest known fact concerning the homology of algebraic varieties.
