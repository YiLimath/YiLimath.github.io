In this series of notes we will summarize some standard metric methods which will be useful in birational geometry.

[1. The Ohsawaâ€“Takegoshi extension theorem and why it's uesful in birational geometry](),

[2. The theorem of Angehrn and Siu](),

[3. Siu's invariance of plurigenera analytic proof](),

[4. Limiting metric arguement in birational geometry](),

[5. Bergman metric, positivity and canonical bundle formula](),

[6. Birational boundedness for varieties of general type](),

[7. Supercanonical metric and abundance conjecture](),
