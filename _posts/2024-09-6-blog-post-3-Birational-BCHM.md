This aim of this series of notes is to study the classical paper [BCHM](https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/2010-23-02/S0894-0347-09-00649-3/S0894-0347-09-00649-3.pdf) in details. We will try to finish the proof of the main theorem and summarize some interesting applications of BCHM. We will not strictly follow the structure of the original paper, instead we will divide the paper into several topics discussion, including: Existence of flip, existence of minimal model, termination problem, non-vanishing conjecture and finite generation problem. Note that one of the induction steps (say finite generation implies existence of pl flipsï¼‰was already done in our previous note see [Existence of flips](https://yilimath.github.io/posts/2024/08/Existence-of-flips/).

## Part 1: Ingredient of BCHM 

This time we will . We will show the logtic independent relation between different theorems in the paper. We will also briefly sketch some recent progress after BCHM.

## Part 2: Consequences of BCHM
---

We will continue our discussion on the paper [BCHM](https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/2010-23-02/S0894-0347-09-00649-3/S0894-0347-09-00649-3.pdf). 


We summarize the consequences that we will prove during the lecture:

(1) Two minimal models are isomorphic in codimension 1, and connected by finite sequence of flops,

(2) Existence and finiteness theorem of canonical models of moduli space of stable curves with fixed genus and marked point with general type log canonical divisor,

(3) Finite generation of the Cox ring associated to a sequence of divisors, as a consequence the log Fano varieties are Mori dream space.

(4) When the log canonical divisor is not pseudo-effective, the pair admits a Mori fibre space structure.

(5) DLT modification, existence of small Q-factorization.

(6) The crepant extraction theorem: there exist a crepant resolution that the set of exceptional divisors coinside with the pre given set of divisors. Extraction of certain set of divisors.

(7) The Batyrev's theorem (theorem 1.3.5 of the paper) that the cone of nef curves is a rational polyhedron and any co-extreme ray is generated by the pull back of class of curves contracting by some Mori fibre space.

(8) Inversion of adjunction.

(9) A projectivity criterion: a proper Moishezon morphism

## Note-7: Non-vanishing Conjecture
----
As Professor Kawamata says in his book [Algebraic Varieties: Minimal Models and Finite Generation (translated by Professor Chen Jiang)](https://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Varieties-Generation-Cambridge-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B0CW1BCS7J/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1511UB4M5JV9Z&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZC9_Ex0OWqO7D4WpEB3nrQ.PC0ohE-R0Gh6-MF9GtPU6As6szfH0LaO_TBoS6MX-E0&dib_tag=se&keywords=Finite+generation+minimal+model+%5C&qid=1739273152&sprefix=finite+generation+minimal+model+%2Caps%2C316&sr=8-1):

> The content of the non-vanishing theorem is to show the weak effectivity (numerically equivalent to an effective divisor) assuming the pseudo-effectivity. At the first glance the difference between effectivity and pseudo-effectivity seems small. But in fact this difference is the root of difficulty and fun in the minimal model theory. It asserts that some nature of mathematics is condensed in the boundary of the cone of big divisors. The base point free theorem is also a statement of this type. - Kawamata.

And also 

>  if one wants to try to prove the existence of minimal models without the BCHM condition, proving the non-vanishing theorem is a key point. - Kwamata.


We see that non-vanishing conjecture is the central problem in Birational Geometry. In this note, we will give a detail introduction of this conjecture, and prove under BCHM condition the non-vanishing conjecture holds.

## Note-3 Existence of flips
---

The aim of this series of notes is to summarize the idea in the proof of existence of flips (see the paper [Extension theorems and the existence of flips](https://academic.oup.com/book/6326/chapter-abstract/150033223?redirectedFrom=fulltext), [On the existence of flips](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0507597), and also [BCHM II](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/article?mr=2601040) and more recent results by Hacon-Xu, Birkar [Existence of log canonical closures](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-012-0409-0) and [Existence of log canonical flips](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/article?mr=2929730)). 

Here is the outline: 

Part 1) We will give an overview about the problem and show that it's suffics to prove the finite generation of restricted algebra,

Part 2) We will prove the Hacon Mckernan's extension theorem, which is the technical core of the proof of the main result. The proof can be divided into 2 step. In step 1 we prove the sequzing extra positivity lemma, which allows to lift section after some ample twist. In step 2, we will finish the proof of Hacon Mckernan extension theorem by ... 

As a side remark, Hacon Mckernan's extension theorem will be used over and over again in the feature (see [Shokurov Rationally Connectedness conjecture](https://yilimath.github.io/posts/2024/08/Shokurov-Rationally-Connectedness/), and [Boundedness of general type](https://yilimath.github.io/posts/2024/08/Boundedness-general-type/), and [Deformation of Fano varieties](https://yilimath.github.io/posts/2024/08/Deformation-Fano/)).

Part 3) We will prove that restricted algebra is an limiting algebra (in some higher model), Hacon and Mckernan gave 2 approaches at this point: The 1st one use the theorem by Shokurov that a limiting algebra is finite generated if it's saturated and semiample, and trying to check the saturated and semiampleness condition. 

The 2nd version is much simpler, and it's integrated in the spraling induction of BCHM. The result is obvious once we finish the proof of the restricted algebra is a geometric algebra in lower dimension. Since we can then invoke the BCHM F(n-1) induction hyphothsis.
