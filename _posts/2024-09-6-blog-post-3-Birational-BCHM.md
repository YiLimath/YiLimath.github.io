This aim of this series of notes is to study the classical paper [BCHM](https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/2010-23-02/S0894-0347-09-00649-3/S0894-0347-09-00649-3.pdf) in details. We will try to finish the proof of the main theorem and summarize some interesting applications of BCHM. After that we will also summarize the known results after BCHM. One of the induction steps (say finite generation implies existence of pl flipsï¼‰was already done in our previous note see [Existence of flips](https://yilimath.github.io/posts/2024/08/Existence-of-flips/).

## Part 1: Overview 

This time we will list the main results of this paper. We will show the logtic independent relation between different theorems in the paper. We will also briefly sketch some recent progress after BCHM.

## Part 2: Consequences of BCHM

We will continue our discussion on the paper [BCHM](https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/2010-23-02/S0894-0347-09-00649-3/S0894-0347-09-00649-3.pdf). 


We summarize the consequences that we will prove during the lecture:

(1) Two minimal models are isomorphic in codimension 1, and connected by finite sequence of flops,

(2) Existence and finiteness theorem of canonical models of moduli space of stable curves with fixed genus and marked point with general type log canonical divisor,

(3) Finite generation of the Cox ring associated to a sequence of divisors, as a consequence the log Fano varieties are Mori dream space.

(4) When the log canonical divisor is not pseudo-effective, the pair admits a Mori fibre space structure.

(5) DLT modification, existence of small Q-factorization.

(6) The crepant extraction theorem: there exist a crepant resolution that the set of exceptional divisors coinside with the pre given set of divisors. Extraction of certain set of divisors.

(7) The Batyrev's theorem (theorem 1.3.5 of the paper) that the cone of nef curves is a rational polyhedron and any co-extreme ray is generated by the pull back of class of curves contracting by some Mori fibre space.

(8) Inversion of adjunction.

(9) A projectivity criterion: a proper Moishezon morphism
