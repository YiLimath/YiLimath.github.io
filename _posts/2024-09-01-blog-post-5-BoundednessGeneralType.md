The aim of this series of notes is to summarize the bounded results for the varieties of general type. 

Here is the outline of this series of notes:
(1) Part I: We will mainly focus on the classical paper by Hacon and Mckernan [Boundedness of pluricanonical maps of varieties of general type](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-006-0504-1), 

(2) Part II: We will mainly focus on the DCC condition on volume of a log pair (see [On the birational automorphisms of varieties of general type](https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2013/177-3/p06), [Boundedness of moduli of varieties of general type](https://ems.press/journals/jems/articles/15330) and also [Boundedness of moduli of varieties of general type](https://ems.press/journals/jems/articles/15330)),

(3) Part III: We will mainly focus on the ACC for log canonical threshold (see [ACC for log canonical thresholds](https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2014/180-2/p03)),

(4) Part Iv: We will mainly focus on the boundedness results for varieties with general type condition (see ...) .
