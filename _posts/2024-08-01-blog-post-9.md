The aim of this note is to summarize the idea in the proof of existence of flips (see the paper [Extension theorems and the existence of flips](https://academic.oup.com/book/6326/chapter-abstract/150033223?redirectedFrom=fulltext) and also [On the existence of flips](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0507597)). This note can be viewed as the supplementary for the BCHM reading seminar. 

In the first part of the note we will prove the technical core of the theorem say Hacon Mckernan's extension theorem. We will first prove the sequzing extra positivity lemma, which allows to lift section after some ample twist. We will then go to the proof of Hacon Mckernan extension theorem.
