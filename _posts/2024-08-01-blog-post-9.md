The aim of this note to introduce the Griffith's curvature formula, which is the starting point of the study of positivity results in algebraic geometry


For detailed information see my reading notes (coming before) [Griffiths curvature formula](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Hodge/GriffithCurvatureFormula.pdf)
