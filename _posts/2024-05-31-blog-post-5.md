We will continue our discussion on the paper [BCHM](https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/2010-23-02/S0894-0347-09-00649-3/S0894-0347-09-00649-3.pdf). Today we will prove two consequences of BCHM, the first one shows two minimal models are connected by finite sequence of flops. The second one shows that the canonical model of moduli spaces of stable curves with n-marked points are always exist as long as log canonical divisor is of general type, moreover if the coefficient of the boundary divisor is bounded away from zero then the .
