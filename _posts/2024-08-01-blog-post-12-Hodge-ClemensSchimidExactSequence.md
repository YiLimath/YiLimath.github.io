In this note we will prove the local invariant cycle theorem, introduce the Wang's exact sequence and it's modification and finally the Clemens-Schimid exact sequence.

For detailed information see my reading notes [Local invariant cycle theorem and Clemens-Schimid exact sequence](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Hodge/ClemensSchmid.pdf)
