本文是基于道德经以及庄子启发, 所发现了一套系统的依赖于道家思想的数学研究方法论(methodology)。

(1) First, What is math? Mathematics is an activity centered on solving mathematical problems or building mathematical theories. Therefore, if you say, "I want to build a theory about physics or AI," those tasks do not fit my definition of mathematics. I don’t believe mathematicians can accomplish such tasks—constructing the theory of a specific field is the job of experts in that field.

Based on this definition, I disagree with the concept of interdisciplinary research. While I acknowledge that people from different fields should communicate—sharing methodologies, research approaches, or even discovering connections between disciplines—I doubt whether this truly constitutes a meaningful **scientific connection**. I am more and more convinced that interdisciplinary research is misguided.

(2) Second, a fancy research topic does not equal to a valuable one (young people should learn to modify their instincts). Most research topics may seem boring but are far more valuable than fancy ones.

(3) Learning mathematics is about understanding proofs. If you read an entire book but cannot prove the theorems yourself, you haven’t truly completed the reading.


(4) Mathematical research should focus on the new **phenonmenon**, new **math structure** that appears. One should have the ability to distinct **trivial** part and **non-trivial** part of the proof. So we should ask ourself repeatly: why the theorem is non-trivial?

(5) I prefer doing math while do not ask "How to apply it (in the real world)?".

(6) Mathematic is **not about concept**, although people require to learn certain amount of knowledge to speak about something clearly.
