The following lesson that learnt when doing mathematics.

# 0. What should avoid when learning math?

(1) First, What is math? Mathematics is an activity centered on solving mathematical problems or building mathematical theories. Therefore, if you say, "I want to build a theory about physics or AI," those tasks do not fit my definition of mathematics. I don’t believe mathematicians can accomplish such tasks—constructing the theory of a specific field is the job of experts in that field.

Based on this definition, I disagree with the concept of interdisciplinary research. While I acknowledge that people from different fields should communicate—sharing methodologies, research approaches, or even discovering connections between disciplines—I doubt whether this truly constitutes a meaningful **scientific connection**. I am more and more convinced that interdisciplinary research is misguided.

(2) Second, a fancy research topic does not equal to a valuable one (young people should learn to modify their instincts). Most research topics may seem boring but are far more valuable than fancy ones.

(3) Learning mathematics is about understanding proofs. If you read an entire book but cannot prove the theorems yourself, you haven’t truly completed the reading.

(4) Mathematics alone cannot solve every problem in the world. History shows that while math provided the foundation for classical mechanics, electromagnetism, and quantum theory, this does not mean it is the sole driving force behind scientific progress. Unfortunately, as a mathematics student, I must point out: if you are fascinated by this narrative, you'd better studying physics (or eigineering) instead of math. However, I should clearfy the misconception, this does not means math is not valuable (as inciated by (2)), what I want to stress is the "narrative" above is wrong.
