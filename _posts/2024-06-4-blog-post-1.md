We will continue our discussion on the paper [BCHM](https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/2010-23-02/S0894-0347-09-00649-3/S0894-0347-09-00649-3.pdf). Last time we prove two fundamental consequences of BCHM, the first one is two minimal models are connected by flops, the second one shows the existence and finiteness of canonical models of 

This time we will show the following results:
(1) when the log canonical divisor is not pseudo-effective then the pair admits a Mori fibre space structure,
(2) the crepant extraction theorem: there exist a crepant resolution that the exceptional divisors admits the given set of exceptional divisors,
(3) Finite generation of Cox ring associated to a sequence of divisors with general type assumption, as a consequence we will prove the log Fano variety is a Mori dream space.
(4) If time permitted we will prove also the Batyrev's theorem (theorem 1.3.5 of the paper) that the cone of nef curves is a rational polyhedron s.t.
