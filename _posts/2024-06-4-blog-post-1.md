We will continue our discussion on the paper [BCHM](https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/2010-23-02/S0894-0347-09-00649-3/S0894-0347-09-00649-3.pdf). Last time we proved two fundamental consequences of BCHM, the first one was two minimal models are connected by flops, the second one showed the existence and finiteness theorem of canonical models of moduli space of stable curves with fixed genus and marked point with general type log canonical divisor.

This time we will show the following results:

(1) Finite generation of the Cox ring associated to a sequence of divisors, as a consequence the log Fano varieties are Mori dream space.

(2) When the log canonical divisor is not pseudo-effective, the pair admits a Mori fibre space structure.

(3) The crepant extraction theorem: there exist a crepant resolution that the set of exceptional divisors coinside with the pre given set of divisors.

(4) If time permitted we will prove also the Batyrev's theorem (theorem 1.3.5 of the paper) that the cone of nef curves is a rational polyhedron and any co-extreme ray is generated by the pull back of class of curves contracting by some Mori fibre space.

For detailed information see my lecture notes (coming soon before 2024.5.9) [BCHM part 3](https://yilimath.github.io/files/BCHM/BCHM3.pdf)
