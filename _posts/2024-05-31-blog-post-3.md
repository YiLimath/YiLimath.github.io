Today we will continue our discussion on the paper on Moishezon morphisms. Last time, we proved that a Moishezon manifold admits a (strong) Hodge decomposition. We also showed that a KÃ¤hler Moishezon space with 1-rational singularity is automatically projective, and finally, we gave three different definitions for Moishezon morphism and proved that they are equivalent. 


This time:

- We will prove that a proper surjective morphism equipped with a relatively big line bundle is locally bimeromorphic to a projective morphism.

- We will prove that if the base space is Moishezon, then the total space is Moishezon if and only if the morphism is Moishezon.

- We will show that the restriction of the generic surjective morphism on the exceptional set is a Moishezon morphism.
