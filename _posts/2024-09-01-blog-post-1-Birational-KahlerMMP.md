The aim of this note is to introduce the minimal model program for Kahler varieties. Compared with the well-known minimal model program for projective varieties, the theory of Kahler minimal model program will have the following 3 major difficuilties: (1) Mori bend-and-break technique: Mori bend and break is not known for Kahler varieties, (2) The base point free theorem: Since Kahler manifold with big line bundle is automatic projective, thus big line bundle does not make sense on (non-projective) Kahler manifold, (3) Contraction theorem: In the classical MMP, we require the base point free theorem to produce some semi-ampleness divisor. This semi-ample divisor will induce the negative contraction morphism, this approach is not very clear under Kahler setting.

For Kahler 3 fold, the minimal model program is well established (see [Minimal models for Kahler 3-fold](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-015-0592-x), and [Bimeromorphic geometry of Kahler threeholds](https://math.univ-cotedazur.fr/~hoering/articles/a30-kaehler-survey.pdf), and [The log minimal model program for Kahler 3-folds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05924v4)). Horing and Peternell's idea is to construct the contraction morphism in Kahler MMP via nef reduction map, and the theory depends on the deformation theoretic analysis of negative extremal ray. They divde the problem into 3 cases based on the rigidity of the generator of that negative extremal ray. To be more precise ...

For Kahler 4 fold, ...

## Note-4 Extension of contraction morphism

This note will study the extension problem for contraction morphism. The most difficult part of Kahler MMP is the construction of contraction morphism. The extension of contraction morphism says if we have contraction on the central fiber, then we also have the contraction for the relative MMP.

## Supplementary 3: Around BDPP

This note will give a brief introduction to the classical paper: [BDPP](http://sebastien.boucksom.perso.math.cnrs.fr/publis/BDPP.pdf). There are 2 major achievement in this paper:

(1) The duality between algebraic pseudo-effective cone and mobile cone of curves on a projective manifold,
(2) The projective manifold is uniruled iff it's not pseudo-effective.

We will first briefly summarize the idea of the proof, and then focus on the applications of BDPP in deformation theory and minimal model theory.

The duality between algebraic pseudo-effective cone and mobile cone of curves is based on the so called tran
