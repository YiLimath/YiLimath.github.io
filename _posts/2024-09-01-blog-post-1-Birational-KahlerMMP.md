The aim of this note is to introduce the minimal model program for Kahler varieties. Compared with the well-known minimal model program for projective varieties, the theory of Kahler minimal model program will have the following 3 major difficuilties: (1) Mori bend-and-break technical: Mori bend and break is not known for Kahler varieties, (2) The base point free theorem: since Kahler manifold with big line bundle is automatic projective, thus big line bundle does not make sense on (non-projective) Kahler manifold, (3) Contraction theorem: In the classical MMP, we require the base point free theorem to produce some semi-ampleness divisor. This semi-ample divisor will induce the negative contraction morphism. In analytic case we do not have such contraction.

For Kahler 3 fold, the minimal model program is well established (see [Minimal models for Kahler 3-fold](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-015-0592-x), and [Bimeromorphic geometry of Kahler threeholds](https://math.univ-cotedazur.fr/~hoering/articles/a30-kaehler-survey.pdf), and [The log minimal model program for Kahler 3-folds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05924v4)). Horing and Peternell's idea is to construct the contraction morphism in Kahler MMP via nef reduction map. They divde the problem into 3 cases based on the rigidity of the generator in the extremal ray. To be more precise ...

For Kahler 4 fold, ...
