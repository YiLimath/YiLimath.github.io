In today's lecture we will continue the discussion of NonAbelian Hodge theory (NAH), in this lecture we will discuss the character variety (which is also called Betti moduli space).

(1) We will briefly recall the geometric invariant theory,
(2) We prove that space of representation of finite generated group is an affine variety,
(3) 


For detailed information see my notes [Lec-7 Applications of Ahlfors estimate, geometric information coming from fundamental group representation](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Hodge/HyperLec6.pdf)
