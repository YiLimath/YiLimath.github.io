The aim of this notes is to summarize the idea in the proof of existence of flips (see the paper [Extension theorems and the existence of flips](https://academic.oup.com/book/6326/chapter-abstract/150033223?redirectedFrom=fulltext) and also [On the existence of flips](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0507597)). This notes can be viewed as the supplementary for the BCHM reading seminar.

For detailed information see my reading notes (coming before 2024.6.16) [Existence of flips](https://yilimath.github.io/files/BCHM/ExistenceOfFlips.pdf)
