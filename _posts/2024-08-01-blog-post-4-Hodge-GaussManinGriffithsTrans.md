The aim of this note is to introduce the Gauss Manin connection and Griffiths transversality theorem.


Here is the outline of the notes:

(1) We will give an algebraic construction of Gauss Manin connection due to Katz and Oda,

(2) We will give an differential geometric proof of Griffiths transversality theorem.





For detailed information see my reading notes
