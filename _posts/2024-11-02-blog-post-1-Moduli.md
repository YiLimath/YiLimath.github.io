## Note-: Positivities and singularities on moduli spaces


We will briefly introduce the Murphy’s law proposed by Vakil. Vakil shows: Fix any scheme of finite type. There is a moduli space of smooth projective surfaces with very ample canonical divisor which is locally (in the smooth topology) isomorphic to that scheme. In particular: The moduli space has arbitrarily many components: $Z=\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}[x, y] /\langle(x-y)(x-2 y)(x-3 y) \ldots\rangle$. The moduli space is non-reduced: $Z=\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}[x] /\left\langle x^n\right\rangle$.

## Note-: Moduli space of smooth curves, stable curves


We will briefly introduce the construction of the moduli space of smooth curves: The construction use Mumford GIT method. 

The moduli space of stable curves has the following property:

(1) It's reduced and irreducible. In particular, every stable nodal curve can be smoothed,

(2) It's projective; proper and has an ample line bundle,

(3) It has quotient singularities; even better it is globally the quotient of a smooth projective variety,

(4) Every pluricanonical form lifts to a resolution,

(5) The log pair associated to the compactification of the moduli of smooth curves is LC and has ample log canonical divisor,

## Note Short introduction to KSBA theory

The KSBA construction use MMP and semistable reduction instead of GIT method in the moduli space of stable curves and Hodge theory method in the moduli space of .
