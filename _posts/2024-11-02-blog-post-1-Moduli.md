## Note-0: Coarser moduli, representability

Here are some moduli spaces that has properness property

(1) 

(2) The moduli functor of stable varieties has a coarse moduli
space that is locally of finite type,

(3)

(2) Connected components of moduli space of stable varieties are proper (Karu, Alexeev, Hacon-McKernan-Xu),

## Note-2: Separatedness of moduli spaces

The aim of this note is to summarize the known results about separatedness of moduli spaces and applications of this good moduli property.

Here are some moduli spaces that has separatedness property:

(1) Moduli space of hyperbolic complex structures on a complex manifold, due the finiteness of automorphism group. 

(2) Moduli functor of polarized varities with log terminal singularities and nef canonical class (see e.g. [Remarks on minimal models of degenerations](http://sebastien.boucksom.perso.math.cnrs.fr/notes/Remarks_minimal_models.pdf)),

(3) KSBA moduli (moduli space of projective varieties of general type), where the seperateness due to the finiteness of the automorphism group .


Here are some applications of seperateness properties in moduli theory:

(1) We can prove for a smooth family of complex manifolds, if there are uncountable hyperbolic fibers that isomorphic to S then all the fibers are hyperbolic and isomorphic to S,

(2)

## Note-3: Projectivity

Here are some moduli spaces that has separatedness property:

(1) Moduli space of hyperbolic complex structures on a complex manifold,

(2) Deligne–Mumford moduli space of stable curves (a nice reference can be found here [Projectivity of the moduli of curves](https://chngr.github.io/assets/mgbar.pdf)),

(3) Connected components of moduli space of stable varieties (Fujino, Kovacs-Patakfalvi),

(4)

## Note-4: Boundedness of moduli spaces

The aim of this note is to summarize the known results about Boundedness of moduli spaces and applications of this good moduli property.

Here are some moduli spaces that has boundedness property:

(1) Boundedness of canonical models with fixed volume (or bounded volume). (see []())

(2) Boundedness of semi-log canonical models (or log canonical models) with fixed volumes and DCC coefficients (see []()), 

(3) Family of Fano manifolds (see ), epsilon-LC Fano varieties with fixed volumes(see ),

## Note-: Positivities and singularities on moduli spaces


We will briefly introduce the Murphy’s law proposed by Vakil. Vakil shows: Fix any scheme of finite type. There is a moduli space of smooth projective surfaces with very ample canonical divisor which is locally (in the smooth topology) isomorphic to that scheme. In particular: The moduli space has arbitrarily many components: $Z=\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}[x, y] /\langle(x-y)(x-2 y)(x-3 y) \ldots\rangle$. The moduli space is non-reduced: $Z=\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}[x] /\left\langle x^n\right\rangle$.

## Note-: Moduli space of smooth curves, stable curves


We will briefly introduce the construction of the moduli space of smooth curves: The construction use Mumford GIT method. 

The moduli space of stable curves has the following property:

(1) It's reduced and irreducible. In particular, every stable nodal curve can be smoothed,

(2) It's projective; proper and has an ample line bundle,

(3) It has quotient singularities; even better it is globally the quotient of a smooth projective variety,

(4) Every pluricanonical form lifts to a resolution,

(5) The log pair associated to the compactification of the moduli of smooth curves is LC and has ample log canonical divisor,
