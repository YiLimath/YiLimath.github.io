The aim of this note is to give an algebraic proof of Siu's invariance of plurigenera (under the general type assumption).

For detailed information see my reading notes (coming before) [Siu's invariance of plurigenera](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Boundedness/AlgebraicInvarianceOfPlurigenera.pdf)
