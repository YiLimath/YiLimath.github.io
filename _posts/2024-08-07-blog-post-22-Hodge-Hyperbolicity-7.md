In today's lecture we will begin the discussion of NonAbelian Hodge theory (NAH).

The topics will be discussed in today's lecture are:
(1) We will introduce Simpson's classical result that on a compact Kahler manifold the polystable Higgs bundle with vanishing 1st and 2nd Chern class exist a Hitchin-Simpson connection,
(2) We introduce Corlette's theorem which shows the correspondence between fundamental group representation and existence of harmonic map, we go further and showing that existence of harmonic metric correspond to the existence of polystable Higgs bundle with vanishing Chern class,
(3)
