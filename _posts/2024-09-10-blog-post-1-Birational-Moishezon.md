### Note-1: Overview of the paper

This time we will talk about what is Moishezon space and we will prove some elementary properties of Moishezon space.


---
### Note-2: Basic properties of Moishezon spaces

Last time, we proved some elementary properties of Moishezon spaces. This time, we will continue our discussion about the basic properties of Moishezon spaces. We will then go to Section 3 of the paper, where we will prove the equivalence of different definitions of Moishezon morphisms.


For the detailed discussion see my lecture notes: [Moishezon morphism part 2](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Birational/Moishezon/Moishezon-morphism2.pdf)

### Note-3: Basic Properties of Moishezon morphism

Today we will continue our discussion on the paper [Moishezon morphism](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/pamq/content/vols/0018/0004/a011/index.php?mode=ns). Last time, we proved that a Moishezon manifold admits a (strong) Hodge decomposition. We also showed that a Kähler Moishezon space with 1-rational singularity is automatically projective, and finally, we gave three different definitions for Moishezon morphism and proved that they are equivalent. 


This time:

- We will prove that a proper surjective morphism equipped with a relatively big line bundle is locally bimeromorphic to a projective morphism.

- We will prove that if the base space is Moishezon, then the total space is Moishezon if and only if the morphism is Moishezon.

- We will show that the restriction of the generic surjective morphism on the exceptional set is a Moishezon morphism.

### Note-4: Very big locus, general type locus and Moishezon locus


We will continue our discussion on the paper [Moishezon morphism](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/pamq/content/vols/0018/0004/a011/index.php?mode=ns). First, we will complete the proof that Moishezon morphism is stable under base change. Then, we will delve into today's main topic: the alternation property of the very big locus, general type locus, and Moishezon locus, which is either nowhere dense or contains some dense open subset.

### Note-5: Flat Moishezon morphism is fiberwise bimeromorphic to a projective morphism


This week, we will continue our discussion on the paper [Moishezon morphism](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/pamq/content/vols/0018/0004/a011/index.php?mode=ns). Last time, we discussed the structure theorems for the very big locus, general type locus, and Moishezon locus. As a direct consequence, we verified Conjecture 1 in the paper when the morphism is smooth. This time, we will begin the discussion of Section 4 of the paper. The main theorem of this section is Theorem 25, which shows that Moishezon morphism is not only bimeromorphic to a projective morphism but is indeed fiberwise bimeromorphic to a projective morphism as long as the singularity is mild (and not uniruled). We will prove the theorem this time.
