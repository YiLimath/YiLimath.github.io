### Note-1: Basic properties of Moishezon spaces

We first try to proved some elementary properties of Moishezon spaces. 




For the detailed discussion see my lecture notes: [Moishezon morphism part 1: Basic properties of Moishezon varieties](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Birational/Moishezon/MoishezonVar.pdf)

### Note-2: Basic Properties of Moishezon morphism (1)

This time we go to Section 3 of the paper. We first try to prove prove the equivalence of different definitions (4 definitions) of Moishezon morphisms. We then summarize the basic properties of Moishezon morphism with proofs.

### Note-3: Basic Properties of Moishezon morphism (2)
Today we will continue our discussion on the paper [Moishezon morphism](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/pamq/content/vols/0018/0004/a011/index.php?mode=ns). Last time, we proved that a Moishezon manifold admits a (strong) Hodge decomposition. We also showed that a Kähler Moishezon space with 1-rational singularity is automatically projective, and finally, we gave three different definitions for Moishezon morphism and proved that they are equivalent. 


This time:

(1) We will prove that a proper surjective morphism equipped with a relatively big line bundle is locally bimeromorphic to a projective morphism.

(2) We will prove that if the base space is Moishezon, then the total space is Moishezon if and only if the morphism is Moishezon.

(3) We will show that the restriction of the generic surjective morphism on the exceptional set is a Moishezon morphism.

### Note-4: Very big locus, general type locus and Moishezon locus


We will continue our discussion on the paper [Moishezon morphism](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/pamq/content/vols/0018/0004/a011/index.php?mode=ns). First, we will complete the proof that Moishezon morphism is stable under base change. Then, we will delve into today's main topic: the alternating properties of the very big locus, general type locus, and Moishezon locus, which is either nowhere dense or contains some dense open subset.

Let us first sketch the idea on how to prove the alternating property of very big locus and general type locus. 

As for the Moishezon locus, the basic idea already appear in the paper [[RT1]()] and [[RT2]()]. 

For detailed information see my lecture notes [Moishezon part 4](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Birational/Moishezon/GeneralTypeLocus.pdf)

### Note-5: Flat Moishezon morphism is fiberwise bimeromorphic to a projective morphism


This week, we will continue our discussion on the paper [Moishezon morphism](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/pamq/content/vols/0018/0004/a011/index.php?mode=ns). Last time, we discussed the structure theorems for the very big locus, general type locus, and Moishezon locus. As a direct consequence, we verified Conjecture 1 in the paper when the morphism is smooth. This time, we will begin the discussion of Section 4 of the paper. The main theorem of this section is Theorem 25, which shows that Moishezon morphism is not only bimeromorphic to a projective morphism but is indeed fiberwise bimeromorphic to a projective morphism as long as the singularity is mild (and not uniruled). We will prove the theorem this time.

Let us briefly sketch the idea of the proof:

### Note-6: Algebraic approximation

In today's reading seminar(2024.9.25). We will focus on the algebraic approximation technique. We will study the algebraic approximation for Moishezon morphism. 


Let us first briefly sketch the idea on how to construct the algebraic envelop? We will first consider the projective morphism to an open disk D. Since the deformation functor and Picard functor are representable in this setting. We can therefore construct a universal family over some base S. By the universality there exist a morphism from the open disk D to S. We restrict our attention on the image of the disk on S. And this will give us the algebraic envelop. For the Moishezon morphism to the open disk D. As usual, we try to reduce the Moishezon problem into projective problem via a bimeromorphic morphism. The idea here is we first construct the algebraic envelop for the projective family, and we then apply Artin's result (TODO: How it works) extend the morphism from the projective central fiber to Moishezon central fiber. We finally show that the extension on the Moishezon central fiber gives the algebraic envelop as desired.


The second part of this note introduce some applications of algebraic approximation technique.  We will first use algebraic envelop to show that MMP works for projective family over a Riemann surface. And the singularities of the minimal model and canonical model are nice. We then use the algebraic approximation techniques showing the existence of canonical modification for Moishezon morphism.


Let us briefly sketch the idea on the existence of canonical modification for Moishezon morphism (this part of note will also appear in [Canonical and Terminal modification](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Birational/BCHM/CanonicalTerminalModification.pdf)). We first brrow the result from BCHM that the canonical modification exist for quasi-projective complex variety. Since the algebraic envelop of the Moishezon family is Moishezon, thus it's a Etale cover of some quasi-projective variety. Since canonical modification commute with Etale base change, the canonical modification exist on the algebraic envelop. We then check that the pull back of the canonical modification on the algebraic envelop is indeed the canonical modification of the family that we considered. (There is a question here)

Finally we make a remark that canonical modification may not always exist. For more applications of canonical modification see my note: [Canonical and Terminal modification](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Birational/BCHM/CanonicalTerminalModification.pdf)
