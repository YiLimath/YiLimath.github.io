The purpose of this reading seminar is to discuss the recent paper [Moishezon morphism](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/pamq/content/vols/0018/0004/a011/index.php?mode=ns) by Professor Kollár in detail. Let us first briefly answer the question WHY Moishezon?
> First, Moishezon spaces have more functorial behavior (compared with projective varieties), as we
will see in Section 2. Secondly, from almost any projective variety we can construct a Moishezon
space via bimeromorphic modification, making Moishezon spaces versatile in birational geometry.
Thirdly, by Artin’s fundamental theorem, the category of Moishezon spaces appears naturally in
moduli theory. Another compelling reason to consider the Moishezon category is that it allows cutand-paste operations similar to those we can perform in topology. And finally, let us cite a sentence
by Professor Mori: "Projective varieties are like classical paintings; after modern paintings were
introduced, we could enjoy the classical ones even more. To me, non-projective complete varieties
(perhaps meaning Moishezon spaces) seem like modern paintings."


If you are curious about what modern painting in birational geometry looks like, let us dive into fascinating tour into the fancynating world of Moishezon spaces and Moishezon morphisms.
