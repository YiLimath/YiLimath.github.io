The aim of this series of note is to study the degeneration of spectral sequence in Hodge theory.

Here is the outline of the series of notes

(1) Deligne-Illusie's algebraic proof of E1-degeneration of the Hodge-to-deRham spectral sequence,

(2) Esnault-Viehweg's apporach to E1-degeneration of the Hodge-to-deRham spectral sequence,

(3) ...
