The topics will be discussed in today's lecture is: 

(1) Proof of the Hodge structures in family satisfies the Griffiths transversality condition, 
(2) We will construct the Higgs metric (not necessarily positive definition) and Hodge metric (positive definite) on the Hodge bundle,
(3) We will give a geometric discription of the Higgs field (which is actually the Kodaira-Spencer map),
(4) We will construct the compact dual, period domain, period mapping and we will introduce some basic properties about period mapping and period domain,
(5) We will compute the tangent bundle of period domain, and derivative of period mapping.




For detailed information see my notes (coming before 2024.8.11) [Lec-4 Variational Hodge theory and an introduction to period domain and period mapping](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Hodge/HyperLec4.pdf)
