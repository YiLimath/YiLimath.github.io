In this note we will prove for 1-parameter semistable degeneration, the special fiber has limiting mixed Hodge structur as well as mixed Hodge complex of sheaves. Given a semi-stable family over a disc, we can define a variational Hodge structure on the generic fibers (since smoothness of the family over the punctured disc). We can ask is there some Hodge structure on the special fiber? The answer is yes. We can construct the mixed Hodge structure on the central fiber as follows: First, take a universal cover, and rescal the Hodge filtration on the generic fibers using exponential of the nilpotent operator coming from the monodromy operator. Schimid proved when taking limit after rescaling, the central fiber carries a mixed Hodge structure. With the weight filtration induced by the nilpotnent part of the monodromy operator.
