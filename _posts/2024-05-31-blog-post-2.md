Last time we proved some elementary properties of Moishezon space. Time time we will continue our discussion about the basic properties of Moishezon space. We will then go the Section 3. of the paper, and we will prove the equivalence of different definitions of Moishezon morphism.

For the detailed discussion see my lecture notes: [Moishezon morphism part 2](https://yilimath.github.io/posts/2024/05/Moishezon-morphism-2/)
