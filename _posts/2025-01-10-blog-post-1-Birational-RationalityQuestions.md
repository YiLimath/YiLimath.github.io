The aim of this note is try to summarize the rationality problems in birational geometry. 

Here is the outline of the notes: 


## Part I. A Survey on Birational Invariants

Birational Invariance plays a central role in the study of rationality problems. In the first part, we will survey the old and new birational invariance.
