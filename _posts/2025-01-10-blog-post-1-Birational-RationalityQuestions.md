The aim of this note is try to summarize the rationality problems in birational geometry. 

Here is the outline of the notes


(1) [Note-1: Mori theory on rational curves](),

(2) [Note-2: Rational curves on Kahler variety](),

(3) [Note-3: Deformation of uniruled varieties](),

(4) [Note-4: Smooth Fano variety is rationally connected](),

(5) [Note-5: On Shokurov rationality conjecture](),

## Note-3: Deformation of uniruled varieties
---

The aim of this note is to give an introduction on the Deformation of uniruled problem.
