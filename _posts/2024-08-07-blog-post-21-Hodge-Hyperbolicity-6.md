In today's lecture we will discuss
(1) Flat (p,q) theorem which shows a flat section of Hodge bundle has flat (p,q) component,
(2) Rigidity variational Hodge structure (the fundamental group representation uniquely determine the underlining variational Hodge structure),
(3) We will prove that the fundamental group representation is big iff the period mapping is generic immersive,
(4) Finally we prove that if the fundamental group representation is big and algebraic monodromy is semi-simple then the space is pesudo-Picard hyperbolic and is of general type.
