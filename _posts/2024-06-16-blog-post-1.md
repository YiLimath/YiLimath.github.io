This week, I will write a summary note on the paper [Recent developments in Hodge theory: a discussion of techniques and results](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/article?mr=419850). This paper is a very good starting point to learn something about the degeneration and deformation of Hodge structures. 


For the detailed information see my lecture notes (coming before 2024.6.23) [Hodge theory 1](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Hodge/Hodge1.pdf)
