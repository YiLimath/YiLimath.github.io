In this notes we will study the Hodge decomposition on non Kahler manifold, 

# 0. Overview
We'll start by establishing some fundamental concepts essential for delving into the study of non-KÃ¤hler Hodge decomposition. Following this, we'll have a brief overview on Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence, we'll show its degeneration at the $E_1$ page only if the differential is strict; note that a vanishing $d_1$ does not necessitate implies $E_1$ degeneration.
		
In Section 2 discuss the formal Hodge decomposition, it has three equivalent characterizations and we will prove they are equivalent. In Section 3 we distinct the non natural and natural Hodge structure. In Section \ref{ddbar} we will show two characterizations of ddbar manifold, the first one shows that a compact complex manifold is ddbar iff the Hodge to deRham spectral sequence degenerate at $E_1$-page and the formal Hodge decomposition holds. The second characterization shows that a compact complex manifold is ddbar iff the it carries a natural Hodge decomposition. In the last section, we will prove a interesting result due to Demailly that a complex manifold carries a strong Hodge decomposition as long as its modification is. As a direct consequence Moishezon manifold and Fujiki manifold possess a strong Hodge decomposition (see \ref{Moishezon Hodge}).

# 1. Basic definitions


## Truncated filtration on differential form and deRham cohomology, Formal Hodge decomposition
### 1. Two filtration on the differential

(1) 
$$\text{Fil}^p A^h(X)=\bigoplus_{i=p}^h A^{i, h-i}(X) .$$
(2) $${ }^{\prime \prime} \text{Fil}^q A^h(X)=\bigoplus_{j=q}^h A^{h-j, j}(X)$$

### 2. Filtration on the deRham cohomology
$$\text{Fil}^pH^h(X) = \frac{\ker d^h \cap \text{Fil} A^h(X)}{\text{im} d^{h-1} \cap \text{Fil}^p A^h(X)}$$


### 3. Conjugation relation

We have $$\overline{A^{q, p}(X)}=A^{p, q}(X)$$
and therefore $$\overline{\text{Fil}^q A^h(X)}={ }^{\prime \prime} \text{Fil}^q A^h(X)$$
As a consequence we also has $$\overline{\text{Fil}^q H^h(X)}={ }^{\prime \prime} \text{Fil}^q H^h(X) .$$

### 4. $H^{p,q}(X)$ defined by the filtration
We can define the $H^{p,q}(X)$ using the filtration defined above as $$H^{p,q}(X) : = \operatorname{Fil}^pH^h(X)\cap \overline{\operatorname{Fil}^qH^h(X)}$$
> [!warning] (Distinct the $H^{p,q}(X)$ with the Dolbeault cohomology $H^{p,q}_\bar{\partial}(X)$)
> Note that in general it's not true that $H^{p,q}(X)\cong H^{p,q}_\bar{\partial}(X)$, we will see later that it's true when the truncated filtration defines a Hodge filtration.


## Definition Hodge filtration

### 1st definition of Hodge filtration
We say that the filtration $\left(\text{Fil}^p H^h(X)\right)$ is a Hodge filtration of weight $h$ if
$$
H^h(X)=\bigoplus_{p+q=h}\text{Fil}^p H^h(X) \cap \overline{\operatorname{Fil}^q H^h(X)}  : = \bigoplus_{p+q = h} H^{p,q}(X)
$$


### 2nd definition of Hodge filtration
[[Paper-Note on Dolbeault cohomology and Hodge structures up to bimeromorphisms-2020]]
Lemma 2. The filtration $\left(\text{Fil}^p H^h(X)\right)$ is a Hodge filtration of weight $h$ if and only if
$$
H^h(X)=\text{Fil}^p H^h(X) \oplus \overline{\operatorname{Fil}^q H^h(X)} \quad \text { for every }(p, q) \text { with } p+q=h+1 .
$$

Moreover, if this is the case, there is a canonical isomorphism
$$
\text{Fil}^p H^h(X) \cap \overline{\text{Fil}^q H^h(X)} \simeq\text{Gr}^p H^h(X) \quad \text { for every }(p, q) \text { with } p+q=h,
$$
where $\text{Gr}^p H^h(X)=\text{Fil}^p H^h(X) /\text{Fil}^{p+1} H^h(X)$.

### 3rd definition of Hodge filtration
[[Paper-On deformation of Kahler space]]
The natural homomorphism $$\bigoplus_{p' \ge p}H^{p',h-p'}(X)\to \operatorname{Fil}^pH^h(X)$$is bijective for all $p$.

[[Definition-Constrction of Hodge to deRham spectral sequence for a compact complex manifold]]


## Definition Hodge structure and natural Hodge structure

### Definition Hodge structure
Definition 4. 1. We say that $X$ admits a Hodge structure of weight $h$, if there exist isomorphisms
$$
H_{\bar{\partial}}^{p, q}(X) \simeq \overline{H_{\bar{\partial}}^{q, p}(X)}, p+q=h, \quad \text { and } \quad H^h(X) \simeq \bigoplus_{p+q=h} H_{\bar{\partial}}^{p, q}(X) .
$$
> [!warning] (The non-natural Hodge structure )
> Hodge structure defined above is simply a dimensional constraint, since any two finite dimensional vector spaces with same dimension should (non canonical) isomorphic to each other.

### Definition natural Hodge structure
A Hodge structure as above is said to be natural, if the following conditions hold:
(H1) Every class in $H_{\bar{\partial}}^{p, q}(X), p+q=h$, admits a representative $\omega$ with $\partial \omega=0$ and $\bar{\partial} \omega=0$, i.e., $d \omega=0$. Moreover, the assignment $\omega \mapsto \bar{\omega}$ induces the first isomorphism above.
(H2) Every class in $H^h(X)$ admits a representative $\omega$ which may be written $\omega=\sum_{p+q=h} \omega^{p, q}$, where $\omega^{p, q}$ is a $(p, q)$-form with $d \omega^{p, q}=0$ (i.e. lies in the cohomology class). Moreover, the assignment $$\begin{align}H^h(X)& \to \bigoplus_{p+q = h}H^{p,q}(X)\\\omega &\mapsto\left(\omega^{p, q}\right)_{p+q=h}\end{align}$$ induces the second isomorphism above.

> [!warning] (About the induced map on the cohomology)
> (1) The map $\omega \mapsto \bar{\omega}$ is defined on the level of differential form, to descend it on the cohomology level one needs to check that the map sends cocycle to cocycle and coboundary to coboundary.
> (2) In H2 since $d \omega^{p,q} = 0$ implies $\bar{\partial} \omega^{p,q} = 0$ thus the cohomology class $[\omega^{p,q}]_{\bar{\partial}}$ is well defined.

# 4.  Natural Hodge structure
### Criterion for $X$ to admit a natural Hodge structure (Main)

[[Paper-Note on Dolbeault cohomology and Hodge structures up to bimeromorphisms-2020]] Proposition 7. A complex manifold $X$ admits a natural Hodge structure of weight $h$ if and only if the following conditions hold:
(i) the morphism  $\ker d \cap \operatorname{Fil}^p A^h(X) \rightarrow A^{p, h-p}(X), \omega \mapsto \omega^{p, h-p}$, induces an isomorphism $\operatorname{Gr}^p H^h(X) \simeq H_{\bar{\partial}}^{p, h-p}(X)$ for every $p$ .
(ii) $\left(\operatorname{Fil}^p H^h(X)\right)$ is a Hodge filtration on $H^h(X)$ of weight $h$.

# 5. About ddbar lemma

### ddbar lemma
[[The ddbar lemma for d-closed (p,q) form and logarithmic form]]

### Equivalent characterization of ddbar lemma in terms of filtration
[[Equivalent characterization of ddbar lemma in terms of filtration, a manifold satisfies ddbar lemma iff E1 degeneration and the truncation filtration is a Hodge filtration]].

### Characterization of ddbar manifold (using E1 degeneration and formal Hodge decomposition) (Main)

Proposition 2.9. [[Paper-On deformation of Kahler space]]
Let $M$ be a complex manifold, with $E_1$ degeneration and $\{\operatorname{Fil}^p\}$ is a Hodge filtration then it satisfies the ddbar lemma.

> [!example] (About the condition $E_1$-degeneration)
> In the original theorem we require the condition in (2.2) which is stronger than $E_1$-degeneration condition. In the complex vector space setting however the rest of assumption is automatically true.

### A complex manifold is ddbar manifold iff it admits natural Hodge structure (Main)
