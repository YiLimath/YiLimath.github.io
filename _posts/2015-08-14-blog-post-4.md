# 0. Overview

In this notes we will study the Hodge decomposition on non Kahler manifold. We'll start in Section 1. by establishing some fundamental concepts essential for delving into the study of non-KÃ¤hler Hodge decomposition. Following this, we'll have a brief overview on Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence, we'll show its degeneration at the $E_1$ page only if the differential is strict; note that a vanishing $d_1$ does not necessitate implies $E_1$ degeneration. In Section 2. discuss the formal Hodge decomposition, it has three equivalent characterizations and we will prove they are equivalent. In Section 3. we distinct the non natural and natural Hodge structure. In Section 4. we will show two characterizations of ddbar manifold, the first one says that a compact complex manifold is ddbar iff the Hodge to deRham spectral sequence degenerate at $E_1$-page and the formal Hodge decomposition holds. The second characterization says that a compact complex manifold is ddbar iff the it carries a natural Hodge decomposition. In the last section, we will prove a interesting result due to Demailly that a complex manifold carries a strong Hodge decomposition as long as its modification is. As a direct consequence Moishezon manifold and Fujiki manifold possess a strong Hodge decomposition.

# 1. Basic definitions

## Truncated filtration on the space differential forms

The truncated filtration will be essential in what follows: we define $$\text{Fil}^p A^h(X)=\bigoplus_{i=p}^h A^{i, h-i}(X)$$

There is another filtration defined to be 

$${ }^{\prime \prime} \text{Fil}^q A^h(X)=\bigoplus_{j=q}^h A^{h-j, j}(X)$$


## Induced filtration on the deRham cohomology

The filtration on the differential will induce a truncated filtration on the deRham cohomology
$$\text{Fil}^pH^h(X) = \frac{\ker d^h \cap \text{Fil}^p A^h(X)}{\text{im} d^{h-1} \cap \text{Fil}^p A^h(X)}$$


## Conjugation relation
By definition easy to see the following conjugation relations
We have 

$$\overline{A^{q, p}(X)}=A^{p, q}(X)$$

and therefore

$$\overline{\text{Fil}^q A^h(X)}={ }^{\prime \prime} \text{Fil}^q A^h(X)$$

As a consequence we also has 

$$\overline{\text{Fil}^q H^h(X)}={ }^{\prime \prime} \text{Fil}^q H^h(X) .$$


## Formal (p,q)-cohomology and Dolbeault (p,q)-cohomology

We can define the $H^{p,q}(X)$ using the filtration defined above as 

$$H^{p,q}(X) : = \text{Fil}^pH^h(X)\cap \overline{\text{Fil}^qH^h(X)}$$

Caveat. Note that in general it's not true that $H^{p,q}(X)\cong H^{p,q}_\bar{\partial}(X)$, we will see later that it's true when the truncated filtration defines a Hodge filtration.

## Definition Hodge filtration and formal Hodge decomposition

Now we can define the central object 


Definition. Let $X$ be a complex manifold, the formal Hodge decomposition is defined to be $$H^h(X, \mathbb{C})=\bigoplus_{p+q=k}  H^{p, q}, \text { with } \quad H^{p, q}=F^p\left(H^k\right) \cap \overline{F^q\left(H^k\right)}$$
And we call the filtration $(\text{Fil}^p H^h(X))$ is a Hodge filtration of weight $h$.

The formal Hodge decomposition has the following equivalent characterization:

Theorem. 
Let $\left(\text{Fil}^p H^h(X)\right)$ be the filtration as above then the following are equivalent:
(1) $(\text{Fil}^pH^h(X))$ is a Hodge filtration of weight $h$ and defines a formal Hodge decomposition i.e. 

$$H^h(X, \mathbb{C})=\bigoplus_{p+q=k}  H^{p, q}, \text { with } \quad H^{p, q}=	\text{Fil}^p\left(H^k\right) \cap \overline{	\text{Fil}^q\left(H^k\right)}$$


(2) 

$$
H^h(X)=\text{Fil}^p H^h(X) \oplus \overline{\text{Fil}^q H^h(X)} \quad \text { for every }(p, q) \text { with } p+q=h+1 .
$$

(3) The natural homomorphism 

$$\bigoplus_{p' \ge p}H^{p',h-p'}(X)\to \text{Fil}^pH^h(X)$$

is bijective for all $p$.

Moreover, if this is the case, there is a canonical isomorphism
$$
\text{Fil}^p H^h(X) \cap \overline{\text{Fil}^q H^h(X)} \simeq\text{Gr}^p H^h(X) \quad \text { for every }(p, q) \text { with } p+q=h,
$$
where $\text{Gr}^p H^h(X)=\text{Fil}^p H^h(X) /\text{Fil}^{p+1} H^h(X)$.

Proof of equivalence between (1) and (2).

It's easy to prove the equivalence 

$$H^h(X)=\text{Fil}^p H^h(X) \oplus \overline{{Fil}^q H^h(X)} \quad \text { for every }(p, q) \text { with } p+q=h+1 .$$

iff

$$H^h(X, \mathbb{C})=\bigoplus_{p+q=k}  H^{p, q}, \text { with } \quad H^{p, q}=F^p\left(H^k\right) \cap \overline{F^q\left(H^k\right)}$$


For $c \in \text{Fil}^p H^h$ we denote by $[c]^p$ its class in $\text{Gr}^p H^h$. We define a morphism

$$
\text{Fil}^p H^h \cap \overline{\text{Fil}^q H^h} \longrightarrow \text{Gr}^p H^h \quad \text { by } c \mapsto[c]^p
$$

and show that it is an isomorphism. For the surjectivity, take $[c]^p \in\text{Gr}^p H^h, c \in\text{Fil}^p H^h$. Then we may write uniquely $c=\sum_{i=0}^h c^{i, h-i}$ with $c^{i, h-i} \in\text{Fil}^i H^h \cap \overline{\text{Fil}^{h-i} H^h}$. We have $[c]^p=\left[c^{\prime}\right]^p, c^{\prime}=\sum_{i=0}^p c^{i, h-i}$. 

Since $\sum_{i=p+1}^h c^{i, h-i} \in\text{Fil}^{p+1} H^h \subset\text{Fil}^p H^h$, we have $c^{\prime} \in\text{Fil}^p H^h$. On the other hand, $c^{\prime}$ is also in and $c^{\prime} \mapsto[c]^p$. For the injectivity, take $c \in\text{Fil}^p H^h \cap \overline{\text{Fil}^q H^h}$ such that $[c]^p=0$. This means that $c \in\text{Fil}^{p+1} H^h \cap \overline{F^q H^h}=0$.
