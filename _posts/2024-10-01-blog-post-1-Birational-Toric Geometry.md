This series of note will give a brief introduction to the toric minimal model program. Here is the outline of the note (the major part of this note is based on the online course "Explicit birational geometry" Professor Ambro taught in Tsinghua 2024). More advanced materials will be added later if I learn more about this.

(1) [Note-1: Basic correspondences between Toric geometry and Combinactory](),

(2) [Note-2: Line bundles, positivities and corresponding combinactorial description](),

(3) [Note-3: Birational modification, semi-stable reduction in the toric geometry](),

(4) [Note-4: Cohomololgy theory in toric geometry](),

(5) [Note-5: Toric minimal model program](),

## Note-2: Line bundle and positivies
---

### (0) Moment polyhedral and line bundle



### (1) Nefness (semi-ampleness) criterion

We showed that a line bundle L is nef iff it's semi-ample and it can be characterize using the momemt polytope associated to the line bundle.

### (2) Ampleness, very ampleness critera

In this part of notes, we will prove the following theorems

(1) Toric Chow lemma, 

(2) Q-factorization via subdivision,
