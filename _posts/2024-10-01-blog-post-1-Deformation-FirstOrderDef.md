Let's first give an overview of this series of notes, in this series of notes we will mainly focus on the deformation of algebraic scheme (in the subsequent series of notes we will also study the deformation of line bundle, deformation of coherent sheaves and deformation of vector bundle) but for now, just restrict ourself in the study of deformation of subscheme.

For the deformation of algebraic scheme problem
