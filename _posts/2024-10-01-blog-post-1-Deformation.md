Let's first give an overview of this series of notes, in this series of notes we will mainly focus on the deformation of algebraic scheme (in the subsequent series of notes we will also study the deformation of line bundle, deformation of coherent sheaves and deformation of vector bundle) but for now, just restrict ourself in the study of deformation of subscheme. We try to build the deformation theory of algebraic scheme in a minimal approach. 

Here is the outline of this series of notes

(1) [Note-1: 1st order deformation](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Deformation/1stDef.pdf).


(2) [Note-2: higher order infinitesimal deformation](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Deformation/higherDef.pdf).

(3) [Note-3: Formal deformation and Schlessinger’s Criterion](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Deformation/FormalDef.pdf).

(4) [Note-4: From formal deformation to actual deformation]((https://yilimath.github.io/files/Deformation/ArtinDef.pdf)): We will show that there exist a formal scheme as limit of a formal deformation. We will introduce the Grothendick existence theorem, which shows that . Finally we will introduce the Artin's algebraizable theorem and Artin's approximation theorem. 

(5) [Note-5: A basic introduction to Hilbert scheme, Doaudy space, Chow varieties and Barlet-cycle space](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Deformation/HilbertScheme.pdf).

(7) [Note-7: Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem](),

## Note-0 An overview of deformation theory


How the theory looks like? 




---
## Note-1 1st order deformation: Correspondence theorems
---

In this part of notes we will prove the following theorems


(1) We first study the tangent space of Hilbert scheme and some smoothness criteria,

(2) We then study some commutative algebra and give a local flatness criterion with application for affine deformation problem,

### Correspondence theorems in 1st order deformation (Kodaira-Spencer correspondence)


In this section, we will give a complete summary of correspondence theorems in the deformation theory. 

---
## Note-2 Higher order infinitesimal deformation and obstruction theory
---


### Kodaira-Spencer-Nirenberg theorem



### Smoothness and Obstruction


### Obstruction theory

The general picture is deformation is unobstructed locally (on affine or Stein subset), however when trying to glue them together, the condition for the data to be compactible will cause some problem. And this will impose some vanishing condition in the 2nd cohomology group.

## Note- Deformation of morphism

In this note we will briefly introduce the deformation of morphism theory, with varies applications. Especially we will focus on the applications to the analytic minimal model program (or more precisely the Kahler minimal model program).
