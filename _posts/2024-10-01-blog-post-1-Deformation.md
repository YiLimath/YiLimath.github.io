The aim of this note is to study the deformation theory in birational geometry. 

Here is the outline of this series of notes

(1) [Note-1: Blow up in deformation theory](),

(2) [Note-2: Deformation theory with applications to invariance of plurigenera problem](),

(3) [Note-3: Application of Hilbert scheme, Chow variety in Birational geometry](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Deformation/HilbertScheme.pdf).
