Let's first give an overview of this series of notes, in this series of notes we will mainly focus on the deformation of algebraic scheme (in the subsequent series of notes we will also study the deformation of line bundle, deformation of coherent sheaves and deformation of vector bundle) but for now, just restrict ourself in the study of deformation of subscheme. We try to build the deformation theory of algebraic scheme in a minimal approach. 

Here is the outline of this series of notes

(1) [Note-1: 1st order deformation](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Deformation/1stDef.pdf).


(2) [Note-2: higher order infinitesimal deformation](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Deformation/higherDef.pdf).

(3) [Note-3: Formal deformation and Schlessingerâ€™s Criterion](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Deformation/FormalDef.pdf).

(4) [Note-4: From formal deformation to actual deformation]((https://yilimath.github.io/files/Deformation/ArtinDef.pdf)): We will show that there exist a formal scheme as limit of a formal deformation. We will introduce the Grothendick existence theorem, which shows that . Finally we will introduce the Artin's algebraizable theorem and Artin's approximation theorem.
