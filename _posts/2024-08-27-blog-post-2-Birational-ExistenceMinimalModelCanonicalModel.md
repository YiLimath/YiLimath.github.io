This series of notes will summarize recent development around the existence of minimal model problems.

Here is the outline:

(1) Part I: We will summarize all the known results about existence of minimal model, canonical models (most without proof, but only sketch of some important ideas),

(2) Part II: We will summarize some basic properties of good minimal models,

(3) Part III: We will study the minimal model, good minimal model, canonical model and canonical ring under birational morphism (map),

(4) Part IV: We will study the relation between minimal model and the stable base locus, restricted base locus, augemented base locus (this will be a very interesting topic),

(5)
