This week we will continue our discussion on the paper [Moishezon morphism](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/pamq/content/vols/0018/0004/a011/index.php?mode=ns) Last time we discuss the structure of very big locus, general type locus and Moishezon locus, as a direct consequence we verify the conjecture 1 in the paper when the morphism is smooth. This time we will begin the discsussion of Section 4. of the paper, the main theorem of this section is Theorem 25. which shows that Moishezon morphism is not only bimeromorphic to a projective morphism it's indeed fiberwise bimeromorphic to a projective morphism as long as the singularity is mild (and not uniruled). We will prove this theorem this week.
