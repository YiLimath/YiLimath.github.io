This week, we will continue our discussion on the paper [Moishezon morphism](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/pamq/content/vols/0018/0004/a011/index.php?mode=ns). Last time, we discussed the structure theorems for the very big locus, general type locus, and Moishezon locus. As a direct consequence, we verified Conjecture 1 in the paper when the morphism is smooth. This time, we will begin the discussion of Section 4 of the paper. The main theorem of this section is Theorem 25, which shows that Moishezon morphism is not only bimeromorphic to a projective morphism but is indeed fiberwise bimeromorphic to a projective morphism as long as the singularity is mild (and not uniruled). We will prove the theorem this time.
