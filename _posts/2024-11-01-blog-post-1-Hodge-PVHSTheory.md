The aim of this note is to prove the Existence of mixed Hodge structure on the quasiprojective varieties.

## Note- Gauss-Manin connection and Griffiths transversality condition
---
The aim of this note is to introduce the Gauss Manin connection and Griffiths transversality theorem.


Here is the outline of the notes:

(1) We will give an algebraic construction of Gauss Manin connection due to Katz and Oda,

(2) We will give an differential geometric proof of Griffiths transversality theorem.


### Proof of Griffiths transversality


### Formal introduction to Griffiths transversality and Griffith curvature formula

In this part of note, we will give a formal introduction to Griffiths transversality, by Sabbah and Schnell [Degenerating complex variations of Hodge structure in dimension one](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~cschnell/pdf/papers/VHS-disk.pdf). (My personal comment: This formal introduction may be benefit for DGLA framework. I am not sure yet.)



### Kodaira Spencer map coming from Higgs field


### Higgs feild as the second fundamental form of the subbundle

## Note- Deligne's canonical extension
---


The aim of this note is to introduce Deligne's canonical extension and meromorphic extension. Let us give a brief explianation on what Deligne's meromorphic extension is? Consider a semi-stable family over a disc. Since variational Hodge structure has geometric realization on the smooth projective family, we have a VHS on the punctured disc. The question is can we extend it to the whole disc? ...

## Note- Monodromy Theorem

In this note we will prove the local and global monodromy theorem. We will prove the local monodromy is quasi-unipotent while the global monodromy is semi-simple. We will prove the

## Note- Existence of Limiting mixed Hodge structure
---

In this note we will prove for 1-parameter semistable degeneration, the special fiber has limiting mixed Hodge structur as well as mixed Hodge complex of sheaves. Given a semi-stable family over a disc, we can define a variational Hodge structure on the generic fibers (since smoothness of the family over the punctured disc). We can ask is there some Hodge structure on the special fiber? The answer is yes. We can construct the mixed Hodge structure on the central fiber as follows: First, take a universal cover, and rescal the Hodge filtration on the generic fibers using exponential of the nilpotent operator coming from the monodromy operator. Schimid proved when taking limit after rescaling, the central fiber carries a mixed Hodge structure. With the weight filtration induced by the nilpotnent part of the monodromy operator.
