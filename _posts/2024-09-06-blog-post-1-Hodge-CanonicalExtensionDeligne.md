The aim of this note is to prove the Deligne's canonical extension theorem and Deligne's meromorphic extension. Let us give a brief explianation on what Deligne's meromorphic extension is? Consider a semi-stable family over a disc. Since variational Hodge structure has geometric realization on the smooth projective family, we have a VHS on the punctured disc. The question is can we extend it to the whole disc? The theory of D-module comes into play. Deligne proved that we can construct some regular holonomic D-module over the whole disc equipped with some V-filtration. This can be viewed as a motivation to define the V-filtration.
