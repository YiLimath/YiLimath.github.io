In today's lecture, Professor Ya Deng first gave a brief overview of this series of lectures, then went into the discussion of some basic notions about hyperbolicity.


We can divide this series lectures into 4 parts: 

(1) Part 1: we will discuss the variational Hodge theory develop by Griffiths, Deligne, Schimid.

(2) Part 2: we will discuss NonAbelian Hodge theory.

(3) Part 3: we will discuss NonAbelian Hodge theory in non-arithemedean setting. 

(4) Part 4: we will discuss hyperbolicity.
