In this part of note we will study the Tian-Todorov-Bogomolov Theorem which shows that for Compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, the Kuranishi space is smooth (open disc) in the first cohomology group of holomorphic tangent sheaf.

For detailed information see my reading notes (coming before 2024.8.11) [Tian Todorov Bogomolov inequality](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Boundedness/AngehrnSiu.pdf)
