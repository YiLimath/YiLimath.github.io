This series of notes will discuss the topics about partial modification in birational geometry.

Here is the outline

(1) Canonical modification, terminal modification: 

(2) DLT modification, and crepant extraction theorems: 

(3) semi log modification: For non normal varieties, it's not very clear how to resolve the singularity, we
