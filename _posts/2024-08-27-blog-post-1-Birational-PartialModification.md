## Note-2 Canonical modification and terminal modification, Q-factorialization

In this note we will first prove some existence theorem about the Canonical modification and terminal modification, Q-factorialization. The second part of this note will summarize the applications of these partial modifications.

Let us first briefly sketch the idea on how to prove the canonical modification always exist for quasi-projective complex varieties. The main
