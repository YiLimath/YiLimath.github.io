This series of notes will discuss the topics about partial modification in birational geometry.



Here is the outline

(1) [Note-1: Canonical modification and terminal modification, Q-factorialization](): 

(2) [Note-2: DLT modification, crepant extraction theorem](): We will show the existence results about the canonical and terminal modification. We will then showing some applications of these partial modifications. 

(3) [Note-3: Semi log modificaiton]():
