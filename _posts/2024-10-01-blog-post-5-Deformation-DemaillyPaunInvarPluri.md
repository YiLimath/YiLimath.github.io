Today we will present the Dmailly-Paun's proof on invariance of plurigenera (which originally appear in the paper )

For detailed information see my reading notes (coming before 2024.8.11) [Paun Demailly proof of invariance of plurigenera](https://yilimath.github.io/files/Boundedness/AngehrnSiu.pdf)
