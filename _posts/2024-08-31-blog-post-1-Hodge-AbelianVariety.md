This series of notes will study the Abelian varieties in details. We try to summarize the most important and central results about Abelian varieties in this series of notes. Here is the outline that we will follow:




(1) [Line bundles on abelian varieties](), 

(2) [Cohomology of line bundles on abelian varieties]

(3) [Duality of abelian varieties](),

(4) [Moduli space of Abelian varieties](): Chapter 3 of

(5) [Jacobian varieties](): Chapter 4 of 

(6) [Derived categories of abelian varieties and Fourier-Mukai transform](): Chapter 6

(7) [The Theta Divisor](): 

(8) [Generic Vanishing theorem](): 

(8) [Hodge theory for Abelian varieties](): We will prove that spce of Abelian varieties is one to one correspond to the polarized Hodge structure of weight 1. We will also prove that Abelian variety has Torelli property.

(8) [Hodge conjecture for Abelian varieties] (): Chapter 7
