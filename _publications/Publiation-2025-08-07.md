title: "On Pseudo-Effectivity and Volumes of Adjoint Classes in Kähler Families with Projective Central Fiber"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'This paper is devoted to studying the deformation behavior of pseudo-
effective canonical divisors and volumes of adjoint classes in Kähler families. Based
on recent developments in the Kähler minimal model program, for (flat) families with
fiberwise canonical singularities, we establish the global stability of the pseudo-effectivity
of canonical divisors, assuming in addition that one fiber is projective, while the same
conclusion for Kähler threefolds is also true without the projectivity assumption of
the central fiber. For smooth Kähler families whose central fiber is projective with a
big adjoint class, we show that the volume remains locally constant. Finally, using
the (relative) minimal model program for Kähler threefolds, we verify the deformation
invariance of volumes of adjoint classes and plurigenera for smooth families of Kähler
threefolds, thereby confirming Siu’s invariance of plurigenera conjecture in dimension
three.'
