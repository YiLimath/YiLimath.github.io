	\section{Das-Hacon's approach to divisorial contraction for K\"ahler 3-fold MMP}
	In this section, we will prove the following theorem.
	\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 6.9]{DH24}}]\label{DHdivisorial}
		Let $(X,B)$ be a strong $\mathbf{Q}$-factorial K\"ahler 3-fold KLT pair. With the following condition holds
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $K_X+B $ is pseudo-effective
			\item $\alpha = [K_X+B + \beta]$ is nef and big class such that $\beta$ is K\"ahler,
			\item The negative extremal ray $R = \overline{\text{NA}}(X) \cap \alpha^\perp$ is divisorial.
		\end{enumerate}
		Then there exists an $\alpha$-trivial divisorial contraction $$f:X\to Z,$$such that there exist some K\"ahler form $\alpha_Z$ on $Z$ such that $\phi^* (\alpha_Z) = \alpha$.
	\end{theorem}
	Before going to the proof let us briefly sketch the idea. We first try to prove that the null locus $\text{Null}(\alpha)$ is the Moishezon surface whose smooth model is projective uniruled. We then take a DLT modification $$\varphi:(X',\Delta')\to (X,\Delta)$$ of the pair $(X,\Delta = B+(1-b)S)$ (note that this pair $(X,\Delta)$ differs from the original pair $(X,B)$ and it is not a KLT pair). 
	
	We show that the DLT modification $\varphi$ preserve the geometry outside the null locus $\text{Null}(\alpha)$. We then run the relative K\"ahler MMP for $(X',\Delta')$ over $(X,\Delta)$, which becomes the core of the proof. Since it's K\"ahler 3-fold MMP, the termination is known. So that it's possible to produce positivity (say $K_{X^m} + \Delta^m$ is nef over $(X,\Delta)$) by the termination theorem. 
	
	We need to control the divisors being contracted in the MMP. 
	
	
	So that the induced bimeromorphic map $f:X\dashrightarrow X^m$ is a morphism, and this is the divisorial contraction we want. 
	
	In the final step, we will show that the base point freeness holds for the divisorial contraction, say $\alpha$ as pull back of some K\"ahler form $\alpha_Z$ down stairs. 
	
	\subsection{The null locus is a Moishezon surface whose smooth model is projective uniruled}
	In this subsection, we will proof the following lemma.
	\begin{lemma}
		In the same setting as Theorem \ref{DHdivisorial}. The null locus $\text{Null}(\alpha)$ is a irreducible Moishezon surface, whose smooth model is projective uniruled. Such that the curves in the negative extremal ray $R$ covers the surface $S$ with $$R \cdot S <0.$$
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{remark}
		Let us breifly sketch the idea. The class $\alpha|_S, \alpha|_{S^\nu}, \alpha|_{S'}$ play important role in this lemma (for simplicity let us assume for now that $S$ is a smooth surface). The idea is to try to use that if a smooth surface is not pseudo-effective, then it's uniruled projective surface. The non-pseudo-effectiveness comes from some intersection number analysis. To be more precise, we will use that $S = \text{Null}(\alpha)$, so that volume $\text{vol}(\alpha|_S)  = (\alpha|_S)^2= 0$ (by definition of null locus). In particular, the restriction $\alpha|_S$ can not be a big class. On the other hand, we can apply adjunction to $$\alpha|_S  = (K_X+B+\beta)|_S.$$
		If the coefficient of $S$ in $B$ is 1, then everything is nice and we get $$\alpha|_S = (K_X+B ' + S + \beta)|_S = K_S+ B'|_S + \beta|_S.$$Since $B'|_S\ge 0$ and $\beta|_S$ Kahler, this will imply that $K_S$ can not be pseudo-effective. 
		
		However, the coefficient of $S$ in $B$ is not 1, we need some tricky arguement. Let $\epsilon$ small enough, so that $\alpha - \epsilon \omega$ is still big. Then apply the divisorial Zariski decomposition to $$\alpha - \epsilon \omega  =  \sum c_i S_i + P.$$
		We restrict the class on the surface $S$. If $S_i \ne S$ for all $i$, then $$\alpha|_S = \epsilon \omega|_S + \sum c_i (S_i \cap S) + P|_S.$$The right hand side is big, which contradict to the fact $S$ is null locus of $\alpha$. Thus there exists some component say $S_1 = S$. We try to make the coefficient of $S$ in $\alpha$ is 1. So that we take the \textbf{scaling} that $$(1 + \frac{1-b}{c_1})\alpha|_S= (K_X+B +\beta + \frac{1-b}{s_1}(\sum s_i S_i+ P))|_S.$$
		Note that in this case, the coefficient of $S$ in $\alpha$ is 1. So that we can apply the adjunction $$(K_X+B' + \beta + S + \sum_{j\ge 2} s_j S_j + P)|_S = K_S+B'_S + \beta|_S + \sum_{j \ge 2} s_jS_j \cap S+ P|_S,$$which will imply that $K_S$ is not pseudo-effective. And by the classification theorem of complex surfaces, we know that $S$ is uniruled (and projective as $S$ is assumed to be smooth). 
		
		What nice on the projective uniruled surface is that the (0,2)-Hodge number is 0, so that the Bott-Chern class $\alpha|_S$ can be realized as a $\mathbf{R}$-divisor (which is also a $\mathbf{R}$-curve on the surface). 
		
		Finally, we need to prove that $R\cdot S<0$. To do this, Batyrev cone theorem for movable curve is applied. So that $\alpha|_S =  C_{\epsilon}+ \sum a_j H_j$. We try to prove that there exist a movable curve $H_k$ in the component such that $\alpha \cdot H_k = 0$ and it generates the negative extremal ray $R$. So that apply it to the Zariski decomposition of $\alpha -\epsilon \omega = s_1 S + \sum_{j\ge 2} s_j S_j + P $, we get $$s_1H_i \cdot S = (\alpha -\epsilon \omega)\cdot H_k - (\sum s_j S_j \cdot H_k + P|_S \cdot H_k)<0,$$ using that $\omega$ is K\"ahler, $H_k$ meets $S_j$ properly, and $P|_S$ is pseudo-effective and thus intersection with movable curve is non-negative.

	\subsection{Proof of the base pointness}
	To prove the base point freeness result, we need the following lemma, the first one says that image of pull back of Bott-Chern is those classes that curves being contracted are trivial on it (assume the singularity is nice and ).
	\begin{lemma}\label{pullBC}
		Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism between normal compact complex spaces with rational singularity. If in addition one of the following two conditions hold,
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $f$ is a proper bimeromorphic morphism between Fujiki varieties,
			\item $f$ is surjective, there exist some boundary divisor $B$ such that $(X,B)$ is KLT. Moreover $(K_X+B)$ is $f$-big and nef.
		\end{enumerate}
		Then the pull back $$f^* : H^{1,1}_{\rm{BC}}(Y) \to H^{1,1}_{\rm{BC}}(X),$$is injective, and the image $${\rm{im}}(f^*) = \{\alpha \in H^{1,1}_{\rm}(Y)\mid \alpha \cdot C = 0,\  \forall\ C\in N_1(X/Z)\}.$$
	\end{lemma}
	Thus if the contraction morphism $f:X\to Z$ is $\alpha$-trivial, then there exists some $\alpha_Z \in H^{1,1}_{\rm{BC}}(Z)$ with $f^* \alpha_Z = \alpha$.
	
	
	\begin{remark}
		Before proving the lemma, let us compare this result with the projective contraction theorem. Recall that in the projective setting, if $D$ is a Cartier divisor supporting some negative extremal ray $R$, then $D$ comes from the pull back (i.e. $D\in \text{im}(f^* : \text{NS}(Y) \to \text{NS}(X))$). The proof requires the base point free theorem to show that $mD$ is base point free. Thus, $mD$ is the pull back of Serre twisted line bundle via map associated to $mD$. Finally, using rigidty lemma to show that the Kodaira map coincides with the contraction $f:X\to Z$. Thus the divisor $mD$ is also pull back via $f:X\to Z$.
		
		On the other hand, the transcendental case is relatively easier. Since ... 
	\end{remark}
	\begin{proof}
		
	\end{proof}
	To check $\alpha_Z$ is K\"ahler, we need the following (singular version) Demailly-P\u{a}un K\"ahlerness criterion. 
	\begin{lemma}\label{DPcriterion}
		Let $X$ be a compact normal complex variety. Let $\{\alpha\}\in H^{1,1}_{\text{BC}}(X)$ be a big and nef class. Then $\{\alpha\}$ is K\"ahler iff for any positive dimensional subvariety (or reduced analytic subset) $W$, the following holds true $$\int_W  (\alpha|_W)^{\dim W}>0.$$
	\end{lemma}
	
	\begin{proof}
		
	\end{proof}
	Now we can prove the base freeness for the divisorial contraction $f:X\to Z$, using Lemma \ref{pullBC} and Lemma \ref{DPcriterion}
